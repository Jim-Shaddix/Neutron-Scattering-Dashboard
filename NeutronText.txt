Neutron scattering is one of the most powerful 
probes that condensed matter physicists possess. 
The neutral charge and spin of the neutron allow the 
neutron to probe the bulk of samples, while still 
probing magnetic properties (such as spin waves). 
Neutrons are normally generated at nuclear reactors 
or spallation sources and guided towards a neutron 
instrument. Modern day neutron instrumentation has 
incredibly high resolution, allowing for a detailed
mapping of the structure and excitations of condensed 
matter systems. This detailed mapping has helped us 
understand numerous different systems; such as 
high-temperature superconductivity, quantum spin 
liquids, and electrolytes for batteries.
